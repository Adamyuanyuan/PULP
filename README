Positive and Unlabeled Learning for Prioritization
Alex H Wagner, et. al

Here is a compiled and packaged version of our code for our project. This runs the logistic regression method for producing probabilities for each gene.  The output could then be redirected into a text file and then sorted in decreasing order of probabilities to get the ranking.

Feature vectors are for the training of a retinal degenerative disease model, as described in our paper.
Classifier results are from training features.csv using PULP with the respective regression function.

Usage:

java -jar -Xmx2G CG_Method_LogisticRegression.jar features.csv

OR

java -jar -Xmx2G CG_Method_LogisticRegression.jar features.csv > output.csv
